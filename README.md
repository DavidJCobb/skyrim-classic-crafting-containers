# Crafting Pulls From Nearby Containers, for Skyrim Classic
 A Skyrim Classic mod which makes crafting pull from nearby unowned containers in addition to your own inventory. The goal is to make crafting inside of player homes less cumbersome.
 
 Built with Visual Studio 2019 Community. Requires SKSE source code; files from that are not included unless they needed changes in order to build properly.
 
 I place no limitations on using files in the ReverseEngineered folder. Some of these files are based on research done by the SKSE team, so you may wish to defer to whatever licensing terms they set. Otherwise, files are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) ([legal code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode)) unless otherwise specified.
